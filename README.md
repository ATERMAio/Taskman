# Taskman v0.32a

Taskman is a simple task manager with a timer developed by [ATERMA Studio](https://aterma.io). It is currently on Alpha stage, still testing and adding features.

Version 0.32a:

- You can add tasks and track time.
- Set deadline and note your task status.
- You can see it in action over at: [Vercel](https://atermataskman.vercel.app/)

Known Issues:

- No known issues so far.

Roadmap:

- Hopefully can develop a full app that allows you to add projects and track each project's time and show reports from each project.
- Login and each user should have their own tasks.
- Integration with a DB to store timesheets and tasks on each client seperately.
