# Taskman v0.31a

Taskman is a simple task manager developed by [ATERMA Studio](https://aterma.io). It is currently on Alpha stage, still testing and adding features.

Version 0.31a:

- You can add tasks and track time.
- Set deadline and note your task status.
- You can see it in action over at: [CodeSandBox](https://9cwgrj.csb.app/)

Known Issues:

- Clicking on the complete button should stop the time and change the play button to pause, it currently doesn't do that.

Roadmap:

- Hopefully can develop a full app that allows you to add projects and track each project's time and show reports from each project.
- Login and each user should have their own tasks.
- Create organizations which can house users with tasks and every person can see each other's task as well as assign tasks to each other.
